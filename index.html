                        Pride is remembering where we came from and standing tall for who we are‚Äîall of us. It‚Äôs about every voice that‚Äôs ever been silenced now rising together. We honor the brave hearts who sparked change, and we carry their spirit forward not as labels, but as a united human family demanding dignity.

                        You are more than a word, more than a box to check. Identity is a journey‚Äînot a test. Whether you name it, change it, or choose none at all, you are still whole. This space welcomes every version of you with open arms, because who you are is enough‚Äîalways.

                        Here, family means the ones who see your soul and still stay. It‚Äôs built in the laughter, the tears, the hugs that last too long. Blood doesn't define us‚Äîlove does. You belong in this circle, no questions asked, no conditions given.
